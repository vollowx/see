> Still on developing, DO NOT use for production environment

Run well on Google Chrome, Firefox, Chrome for Android, Microsoft Edge (Chromium), Opera for Android

Core tech:

- Web Components (if you want to use polyfill, import by your self)
- Shadow Root
- Constructable StyleSheets (using polyfill, so now in all browser the styles are `<style>`)
- CSS variable (run well on most browser)
- `:focus-visible` (without polyfill)
- Typescript (only for type check)
